It provides helpful diagnostics for syntax and semantic issues, making it easier for developers to understand and fix their code.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ User-friendly error messages with helpful hints
- 🔁 Function declarations, calls, and argument validation
- 📦 Proper scoping and type checking
- ⚙️ Code generation using LLVM backend (or compatible assembly)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Run the `main.py` file:
